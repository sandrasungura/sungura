Hi! I’m a designer and animator from Madrid. I specialize in graphic design and interface, I also make animations and motion graphics. I also know how to handle myself with Wordpress at intermediate level. I was born in Madrid 25 years ago, and my hobbies are painting, video games, photography and sport.

Have a look to my other websites: <a style="color: rgb(92, 174, 184); font-weight: medium" href="www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-munoz-revilla"> My Linkedin,</a> where you can find my professional trajectory. Y <a style="color: rgb(92, 174, 184); font-weight: medium" href="https://www.artstation.com/sungura"> and my Artstation,</a> with my other projects for videogames.

Why "Sungura"?
</p>

"Sungura" means "rabbit" in Swahili. When I was a little girl I had a pet rabbit and I got very close to it. I wanted my personal website to allude to it in some way, for me it was important. Why in Swahili? Until a year ago, I was part of an NGO Dakari (which means "happiness" in that language) that worked helping sick children and creating social awareness. It meant a lot in my personal and human formation, and I wanted to wink at them.
