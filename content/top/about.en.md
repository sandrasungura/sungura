Hi! I’m UI/UX artist. I specialize in interface for videogames, I also make animations and motion graphics. I know how to handle myself with Unreal Engine at intermediate level. As well, I am studying a master of technical art in UE to make sure the interface ends up perfect in game. I was born in Madrid in 1995 and my hobbies are playing video games, painting, running and playing with my cats.

Have a look to my other websites: <a style="color: rgb(104, 195, 206); font-weight: 400" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-munoz-revilla"> My Linkedin,</a> where you can find my professional trajectory. <a style="color: rgb(104, 195, 206); font-weight: 400" href="https://www.artstation.com/sungura"> And my Artstation,</a> with my other projects for videogames.

Why "Sungura"?
</p>

"Sungura" means "rabbit" in Swahili. When I was a little girl I had a pet rabbit and I got very close to it. I wanted my personal website to allude to it in some way, for me it was important. Why in Swahili? Until a year ago, I was part of an NGO named Dakari (which means "happiness" in that language) that worked helping sick children and creating social awareness. It meant a lot in my personal and human formation, and I wanted to wink at them.
