I’m UI/UX artist. I specialize in interface for videogames, I also make animations and motion graphics. I know how to handle myself with Unreal Engine at intermediate level. As well, I am studying a master of technical art in UE to make sure the interface ends up perfect in game. I was born in Madrid in 1995 and my hobbies are playing video games, painting, running and playing with my cats.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://sandrasungura.github.io/sungura/en/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandrasungura.github.io/sungura/en/contact/</guid><description> Contact me :)
